# Reflection

In this assignment you've learned very basic HTML and CSS, the content and presentation layers of the web. Take this opportunity to think about how they might relate to your work as a historian. 

## Question 1 (150 words)
#### In Part 2, we explored the use of semantic elements such as `<header>`, `<article>`, and `<section>`. These elements make it easier for machines and non-visual browsers to navigate web pages. Why might this be important? (You might want to Google around a bit before answering!)

Semantic elements are elements that clearly define their content. In doing so, semantic elements make web design more accessible, as machines and non-visual browsers are more easily able to render the semantic elements of a web page. Semantic elements are important for accessibility as they provide screen readers and other non-visual forms of web navigation with semantic language for elements that clearly defines a structure and hierarchy for content and tags. So, semantic elements allow more people to read web pages and access content online. A more accessible website means that more people can engage with the content, and this would make content produced by historians gain a wider audience and therefore a wider source of input and communication. The easier the information on the web page is to obtain for a screen reader or non-visual browser, the more accessible that content is to history students, researchers, and others who have disabilities that prevent them from using visual browsers. 

## Question 2 (150 words)
#### In your CSS work, you learned how to change the presentation of material on the web without changing the content. Using a pen and paper, a drawing program, or (if you're feeling ambitious) real HTML and CSS, mock up 2 very different presentations of the information you displayed in your post. Put images of them on the Internet somewhere (but not in this repository) and link to them here. Write a brief paragraph discussing the effect of the presentaiton layer on the reader.

The two additional versions of my blog post each show a different layout from my original html and css blog post. The first drawing of the blog post is a version that is far less well organized and therefore more confusing to the reader. This version has my name in place of the title of the page, with Boudica only being mentioned in the text below. The text, links, and image are placed in awkward places on the page. This layout has the effect of making the reader unsure of the subject of the page. The second drawing shows a much better layout, with Boudicaâ€™s name as the largest element on the page, followed by the image, and then the text. The flow of the page is much more clear and the reader can easily tell what the blog post is about. Clear layout is crucial to good web design.
