                <p>Boudica, Queen of the Iceni, lived from 31 AD to 61 AD. Most well known for her leadership role in the 60 AD celtic revolt against Rome, Boudica was a fierce female freedom fighter. </p>
                <p>Provoked by the injustices committed against the celtic people by the Romans, Boudica and her allies rebelled against Roman Emperor Nero, hoping to free their people from Roman rule. Boudica, her daughters, and her husband all suffered cruelty at the hand of the Romans, adding fuel to the fire of rebellion. The celts had numerous victories, including Camulodunum, Londinium, and Verulamium (modern day Colchester, London, and St Albans). However, the revolt ultimately ended in failure after Boudica’s army was defeated in a single battle by Roman general Suetonius Paulinus. The cause of Boudica’s death remains unknown, but some evidence suggests that she poisoned herself to avoid capture.</p>
                <p>Boudica’s role in history was recorded by Roman historians Tacitus and Cassio Dio, although neither historian was present at the time of the rebellion, and so the accuracy of their accounts is still debated among modern historians. Despite these possible inaccuracies and despite the ultimate failure of her rebellion, Boudica’s legacy as a warrior, mother, wife, and leader remains strong to this day.</p>
